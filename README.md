# Key notes from the discussion today
### Agile
Agile is a term used to describe approaches to software development emphasizing incremental delivery, team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning. The term “Agile” was coined in 2001 in the Agile Manifesto.” Some people will say that it is just a mindset or way of thinking

### Scrum
Scrum is an agile development methodology used in the development of Software based on an iterative and incremental processes. Scrum is adaptable, fast, flexible and effective agile framework that is designed to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the project.

### shippable product

An Increment (sometimes referred to as a 'Potentially Shippable Product') is the value delivered for the customer via the Product Backlog Items completed during a Sprint. Each Increment should interface seamlessly with all prior Increments and stand alone as a distinct addition of value to the Product.

### Retrospective

The sprint retrospective is usually the last thing done in a sprint. Many teams will do it immediately after the sprint review. The entire team, including both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should participate. You can schedule a scrum retrospective for up to an hour, which is usually quite sufficient

### Sprint

Agile projects are broken down into sprints or iterations — short, repeatable phases, typically one to four weeks long. The number and length of the sprints should be determined at the beginning of the project, and each sprint should result in a draft, prototype, or workable version of the final deliverable.

Sprints break down a project into bite-sized chunks. Teams plan a single sprint at a time and adapt future sprints based on the outcome of the previous one. 

While each sprint is planned separately, the number and length of sprints in your project should be determined at the beginning.
